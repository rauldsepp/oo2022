Objektide massiivi loomine ja kasutamine

When we require a single object to store in our program we do it with a variable of type Object. But when we deal with numerous objects, then it is preferred to use an Array of Objects.
The array of Objects the name itself suggests that it stores an array of objects. Unlike the traditional array stores values like String, integer, Boolean, etc 
an Array of Objects stores objects that mean objects are stored as elements of an array. Note that when we say Array of Objects it is not the object itself that is stored in the array but the reference of the object.

Creating an Array Of Objects In Java –

An Array of Objects is created using the Object class, and we know Object class is the root class of all Classes.
We use the Class_Name followed by a square bracket [] then object reference name to create an Array of Objects.

For example, if you have a class Student, and we want to declare and instantiate an array of Student objects with two objects/object references then it will be written as: 

Student[ ] studentObjects = new Student[2];

And once an array of objects is instantiated like this, then the individual elements of the array of objects needs to be created using the new keyword.
